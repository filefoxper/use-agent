# use-agent-reducer <!-- {docsify-ignore-all} -->

[agent-reducer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/agent-reducer) is a very powerful tool, it converts a model object (`OriginAgent`) to be an [Agent](/?id=agent) object. It is designed on the reducer running base. Every thing returned from an [Agent](/?id=agent) method will be a next state.
